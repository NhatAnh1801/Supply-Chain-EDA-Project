# Supply Chain EDA Project
Here is my Exploratory Data Analysis of Supply Chain Dataset from a Fashion and Beauty Startup, you can see more details in `Supply Chain EDA.ipynb` file in my project.
This project is for learning purposes to have a basic understanding of Exploratory Data Analysis, as well as Python using common libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.
## My Approach
My approach is to put myself in the position of a business owner and also data analyst, what kind of questions do I have from this dataset? and how I turn it into business insights to improve operations.
In this project, I classify the analysis into 3 major categories that include `Product & Sales`, `Shipping & Logistics` and `Manufacturing`. Then raise specific questions for each one.
### What I'm Using
- Python libraries:
  - pandas - for data manipulation
  - numpy - for numerical analysis
  - matplotlib - for creating charts
  - seaborn - for better visualizations
- Techniques:
  - Min-max feature scaling for data normalization
  - Summary statistics metrics (mean, median, variance, etc.)

## What Questions I'm Asking
### Product & Sales
- What are the best-selling product types?
- How well do forecasted Availability and actual Stock Levels align?
- Who are our customers ?
### Shipping and Logistics
- What are the lead times per product type?
- Is there a significant correlation among logistics variables?
- What is the most optimal transportation mode ?
### Manufacturing
- Which supplier delivers the highest production volume at the lowest cost?
- Are defect rates correlated with manufacturing lead time or manufacturing cost?
- What percentage of products pass/fail inspection?
## What I've Learned
- **Question framing:** Translating business goals into clear EDA questions ensures every analysis drives actionable insights.  
- **Data preparation:** Creating derived features (e.g., forecast vs. stock difference) and normalizing metrics makes comparisons meaningful.  
- **Effective visualization:** Choosing the right chart-bar, box, scatter, heatmap, pie-helps reveal patterns quickly.  
- **Insight to action:** Pairing each finding with concrete recommendations (e.g., adjust safety stock, review suppliers) turns exploration into impact.
